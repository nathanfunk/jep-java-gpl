       njf - new jjdoc target in build.xml to generate grammar documentation
       njf - removed compile.bat and grammardoc.bat

---- 2.3.0 alpha ----------------------------------------------------
?      njf - NumberFactory has been changed to create the number from a String
             representation (in order to allow creation of arbitrary precision
             numbers without the limitations of double)
