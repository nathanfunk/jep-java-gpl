Many previous changes not included here. See the documentation for details.

Feb 13 04 rjm - added len() and size() functions
		   - added Scaler.getInstance() and Vector.getInstance() methods.
		   
Dec 21 rjm - xjep.PrintVisitor can now work with three or more arguments to + and *.

Dec 10 rjm - Implemented element by element multiplication in VectorJep
