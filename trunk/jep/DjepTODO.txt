TODO for djep suite
03 April 2005

Check new functions in Vectorjep work with MatrixJep.
Check new functions can be differented.

Handle partial derivatives which have constant equations.

New syntatical features
	(x,y,z) for vectors and matrices
	x=-pi:pi:0:20 to specify ranges
	MaxArg(x=-pi:pi:0:20,sin(x))

Investigate potential bug with setting elements of a MatrixVariable
using var.getMValue().setEle()
Does it set validValue flags properly.

Think about using a RealEvaluatorVisitor
with Unary/Binary/Nary RealValuedFunctions

Definable functions 
	foo(x,y)=sqrt(x^2+y^2)
requires (x,y) to be returned as a list.

Allow array access as x[i]

Many more I'm sure.
