TODO for djep suite

For Define function:
improve syntax. So can have Define("half(x)",x/2)
work out how to simplify and evaluate Define statements which don't really have a value. 
fix parser so can do half(x) = x/2

Check new functions in Vectorjep work with MatrixJep.
Check new functions can be differented.

Handle partial derivatives which have constant equations.

New syntatical features
	(x,y,z) for vectors and matrices
	x=-pi:pi:0:20 to specify ranges
	MaxArg(x=-pi:pi:0:20,sin(x))

Investigate potential bug with setting elements of a MatrixVariable
using var.getMValue().setEle()
Does it set validValue flags properly.

Think about using a RealEvaluatorVisitor
with Unary/Binary/Nary RealValuedFunctions

Definable functions 
	foo(x,y)=sqrt(x^2+y^2)
requires (x,y) to be returned as a list.

Allow array access as x[i]

Use a MatrixFactory class for generation of matricies,
could allow other libraries of matrix algorithms to work with JEP.


Many more I'm sure.
