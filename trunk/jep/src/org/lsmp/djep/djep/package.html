Classes to performs differentaion of equations and various utility classes.
The main class is 
{@link DifferentationVisitor DifferentationVisitor}
which performs the differentation by repeated applications
of the chain, product and quotient rules.
Typically the result of differentation should be simplified
to remove occurences of reduant expresions (for example
<tt>diff(x^2.0,x)</tt> is <tt>2.0*x^1.0*1.0</tt> which is simplified to <tt>2.0*x</tt>).
</p>
<p>
For each function a rule is used to specify how to differentiate it.
For example the differative of <tt>sin</tt> is specified using
<pre>addDiffRule(new MacroDiffRules(Jep,"sin","cos(x)"))</pre>
There are various classes of differentation rule which
all implement {@link DiffRulesI DiffRulesI} and have special behavious.
</p>
<p>
Variables can also be differentiated, and the derivative of
<tt>y</tt> with respect to <tt>x</tt> will be represented 
by the {@link PartialDerivative PartialDerivative} <tt>dy/dx</tt>.
To allow this the {@link DVariable DVariable} is used to represent 
variable and
{@link DSymbolTable DSymbolTable} and 
{@link DVariableFactory DVariableFactory} are used to control
the look up of variables and the creation of new variables.
