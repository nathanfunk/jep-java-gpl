An advanced simplification algorithm.
Uses a complete reworking of the ways equations are represented.
An equation like 
<pre>1+2 x^2+3 x y+4 x sin(y)</pre>
is represented as
<pre>
polynomial(
  [monomial(2.0,[varPower(x,2)]),
  monomial(3.0,[x,y]),
  monomial(4.0,[x,function(sin,arg)])]
)
</pre>

<h2>Comparision</h2>
The compareTo method implement a total ordering of all expressions.
The following rules are used to determin the order, 

this < arg ---> -1
this > arg ---> 1
a value less than 0 if this string is lexicographically less than the string argument
a value less than 0 if this Integer is numerically less than the argument Integer
<ul>
<li>-1
<li>0
<li>1
<li>a^-2
<li>a^-1
